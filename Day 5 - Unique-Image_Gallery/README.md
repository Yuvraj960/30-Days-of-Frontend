# Expanding Cards

## Description

This project is a creative way to display a collection of photos using expanding cards. The main page consists of several panels, each containing a different photo. When a panel is clicked, it expands to reveal the full photo and a caption (if you want to add).

## Features

- Responsive design: The layout adjusts according to the size of the user's screen.
- Expanding cards: Clicking on a card expands it to show the full photo and a caption.
- Smooth transitions: The expansion and contraction of the cards are animated for a smooth visual experience.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click on any panel to expand it and view the full photo and caption (depends on you).
3. Click on the expanded panel or another panel to contract it.
