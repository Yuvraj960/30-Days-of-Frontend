# Interactive Sidebar Menu Design

This project is a simple, yet creative and interactive sidebar menu design implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the sidebar menu. It includes various list items, each representing a different section of the website. Each list item includes an icon and a text description.

2. `style.css`: This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the sidebar menu. It includes styles for the list items, icons, and text descriptions.

## Features

The sidebar menu has the following features:

1. **Interactive Icons**: Each list item in the sidebar menu includes an icon. These icons are interactive and change color when hovered over.

2. **Active State**: The list item that represents the current section of the website is highlighted with a different color to indicate that it is the active section.

3. **Responsive Design**: The sidebar menu is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

To use this sidebar menu design in your project, simply include the `index.html` and `style.css` files in your project and link the CSS file in your HTML file.

## Customization

You can easily customize the sidebar menu by modifying the `style.css` file. You can change the colors, fonts, and sizes of the list items, icons, and text descriptions to match the style of your website.
