# Creative Hover Text Animation

This project is a simple webpage that demonstrates a creative hover effect on text. The hover effect can be applied to the navigation menu items.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage. It includes a navigation menu with several items. Each item has a unique hover color defined using inline CSS.

- `style.css`: This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the webpage, including the hover effect animation.

## How to Run

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How it Works

The hover effect is achieved by changing the color of the text when the mouse pointer is over it. The color for each item is defined using a CSS variable (`--clr`) in the inline style for each list item (`<li>` element).

When you hover over a menu item, the color of the text changes to the color defined in the `--clr` variable for that item.
